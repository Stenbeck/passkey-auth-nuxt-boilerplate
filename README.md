# Passkey Boilerplate Site

Nuxt 3 + Passkey + Magic Link Boilerplate

A complete authentication boilerplate using **Passkeys** as the primary login method and **Magic Link (email-based)** as a secure fallback for devices or browsers that do not support WebAuthn/Passkeys — built with Nuxt 3, MongoDB, internal server API and TailwindCSS.

**DEMO**: https://passkey.stenbecklab.com

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔑 Passkey Registration

1. User enters email
2. Challenge is generated and managed
3. Browser asks to store biometric/device auth
4. Credential is saved to the user record

### 🔑 Passkey Login

1. User enters email
2. Challenge is generated
3. Browser prompts for stored credential
4. Challenge is verified, counter is updated, token is set as cookie

### 🔁 Magic Link Login

1. User enters email
2. A secure token is generated and emailed
3. User clicks link → server verifies token → sets cookie

## 🛡 Security Notes

- Passkey challenges are short-lived and stored per user
- Counters are updated to prevent replay attacks
- Tokens are signed and stored with minimal data and short lifespan
- Email logins use one-time tokens valid for 15 minutes

- Security-headers middleware in place (easy to update)
- Custom rate-limiter to avoid brute force and API abuse
- Brute-force protection for mailadresses and failed attemts

## ⚙️ Project Structure

```
/server/api/auth/        ← All server-side logic (register, login, verify)
/server/middleware/      ← Server-side middleware (rate limiter, security headers etc.)
/middleware/             ← Nuxt client-side route guard (e.g. check login status before showing page)
/stores/                 ← Pinia authStore
/plugins/                ← Get user if token exists and store is empty (instead of storing data in cookie or localstorage)
/models/                 ← Mongoose schema for users and loginlogs
/utils/db.js             ← Centralized MongoDB connection helper
/pages/                  ← Only index and dashbaord. Index is the login page and dashboard is a placeholder when logged in
/pages/auth/             ← Only a /callback route for Magic Link to automatically retirect when verified
/components/             ← UI elements
